The slope (#b#) is calculated by:
\begin{aligned}
b = \frac{\sum{(X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}}{\sum{(X_i - \bar{X})^2}}
= \frac{$covar}{$varx}
= $slope
\end{aligned}

#a# is calculated by:
\begin{aligned}
a = \bar{Y} - b \cdot \bar{X}
= $meany - $slope \cdot $meanx
= $intercept
\end{aligned}

The regression line is:
#Y = $intercept + $slopeX#
