### Title

### Question
The sample size (#n#) is $ss. 
The sample mean (#\bar{Y}#) is $mean. Assume #\bar{Y}# is normally distributed.
The sample standard deviation (#s#) is $sd.

The mean expected under the null hypothesis (#\mu_0#) is $mu0.

The significance level (#\alpha#) is $alpha.

Test whether the mean (#\bar{Y}#) is significantly $alternative $mu0 (#\mu_0#).

### Solution

### Options
1. The mean (#\bar{Y}#) is not significantly different from $mu0 (#\mu_0#).
2. The mean (#\bar{Y}#) is significantly different from $mu0 (#\mu_0#).
3. The mean (#\bar{Y}#) is significantly less than $mu0 (#\mu_0#).
4. The mean (#\bar{Y}#) is significantly greater than $mu0 (#\mu_0#).
